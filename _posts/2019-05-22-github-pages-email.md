<p>Since this website is static, we need to use a different approach to a contact form.</p>  

<p>We could spin up a service via heroku, etc., but then we'd have to monitor & maintain it.</p>

<p>Or we could use one of the many services available.  In this case, we are using formspree.io - fast, easy, free or very cheap.</p>
