<p>Since this website is static, we need to use a different approach to a contact form.</p>  

<p>We could spin up a service via heroku, etc., but then we'd have to monitor & maintain it.</p>

<p>Or we could use one of the many services available.</p>   
  
<p>We tested with formspree.io - fast, easy to setup, free or very cheap. But it is not ideal due to branding, no easy redirect, etc. </p>  
<p>We are currently testing with informed.io - it seems easy to setup, and includes a redirect option! But so far all the submissions fail - we have mailed their support and await their reply. </p>
